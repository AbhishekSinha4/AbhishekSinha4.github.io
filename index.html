			<h1>A little about me...</h1>
			<div id="description">
				<p>I am a highly motivated learner intrigued by all aspects of computer science, with a particular focus on data analysis. Years of varsity debating have given me the undeniably infuriating yet advantageous ability to play devil's advocate to most ideas, allowing me to question and further strengthen any analysis. Additionally, my strengths lie in being able to communicate cogently and effectively.</p>
				<p>At the core of it all, I love solving problems for the sake of solving problems.</p>
				<p>As a side hobby, I enjoy playing around with various web technologies.</p>
